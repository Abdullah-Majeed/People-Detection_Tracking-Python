# People-Detection_Tracking-Python

In this project, we utilized YOLOv8 for detecting individuals and counting the number of people present. Additionally, we employed a repository for real-time tracking algorithms, specifically for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences. The repository we utilized can be found at https://github.com/abewley/sort.
